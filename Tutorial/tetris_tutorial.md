# TETRIS – HOW TO PLAY

## Starting the Game

- **Press any button** to start the game.

---

## Controls

### Movement (Joystick)
- **LEFT** → Move piece left  
- **RIGHT** → Move piece right  
- **DOWN** → Soft drop (piece falls faster while held)  
- **UP** → Hold current piece  

### Rotation (Buttons)
- **Button 1 (Pin 3)** → Rotate left  
- **Button 2 (Pin 4)** → Rotate right  
- **Button 3 (Pin 9)** → Rotate left  
- **Button 4 (Pin 10)** → Rotate right  

(Buttons are duplicated so the game is comfortable to play.)

## Gameplay Rules
- Pieces fall from the top of the screen.
- You can move and rotate pieces before they land.
- When a piece lands, it locks into place.
- **Complete a full horizontal line** to clear it.
- Cleared lines increase your score and speed up the game.

---

## Hold Feature
- Move **Joystick UP** to store the current piece.
- If a piece is already held, it swaps with the current one.
- You can only hold **once per piece** (until it locks).

---

## Ghost Piece
- A faint outline shows **where the piece will land**.
- This helps with precise placement.

---

## Scoring (Classic Tetris)
Score depends on how many lines you clear at once:

- **1 line** → `40 × (level + 1)`
- **2 lines** → `100 × (level + 1)`
- **3 lines** → `300 × (level + 1)`
- **4 lines (TETRIS)** → `1200 × (level + 1)`

### Soft Drop
- +1 point for each cell dropped while holding **DOWN**.

---

## Levels & Speed
- Every **10 lines cleared** increases the level.
- Higher levels make pieces fall faster.

---

## Game Over
- The game ends when pieces reach the top.
- The screen turns **solid red**.
- The game does **not** restart automatically.

### After Game Over
1. **Press any button** → return to the scrolling **TETRIS** title.
2. **Press any button again** → start a new game.

---

## Goal
Survive as long as possible, clear lines efficiently, and achieve the highest score.
